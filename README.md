I'm some coder, mostly Typescript + React but it changes.

I'm not super present online, except when I am. Mostly on [cobertos.com](https://cobertos.com)

My biggest bottleneck seems to be the amount of data I manage. It's something I'm working on.

## My Environment

* IDE: Sublime Text
* OS: Linux Mint
* [My dotfiles](https://github.com/Cobertos/dotfiles)
